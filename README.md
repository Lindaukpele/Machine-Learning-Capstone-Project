    Optimize diamond pricing strategies

    Identify valuable product features that influence buying behavior

  **Who This Project Benefits**

    Business Owners – Make smarter pricing and inventory decisions

    Marketing Teams – Create more effective, targeted campaigns

    Investors – Gain confidence from data-backed performance metrics

    ML Practitioners – Explore real-world applications of supervised and unsupervised learning

**Techniques Used**

    Classification (to predict product quality like diamond cut)

    Regression (to estimate price based on features)

    Clustering (to group similar diamonds or customer segments)
